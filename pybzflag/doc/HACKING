Coding guidelines for PyBZFlag:

  - All modules must start with a doc string of the following format:

    """ BZFlag.Package.Module

    An example module that's here for the documentation.
    """

  - Immediately following the module's doc string there must be an unmodified
    copy of the LGPL license heading found on other files. Please add yourself
    to the AUTHORS file rather than keeping copyright on your code.

  - 4 spaces indentation. No tabs.

  - Events and only Events should have names of the form onFoo.
    Observers that aren't themselves event handlers should usually
    be set during a class' initialization.

  - Two blank lines between top-level objects in a module

  - One blank line between objects in a class, except after the doc string

  - Use documentation strings on all but the most trivial classes and functions.
    The content of the string does not yet have to have any particular format.
    Note that it's usually not necessary to document __init__ functions, since
    that documentation should be included in the class' doc string.

  - Accpetable forms for doc strings:

    class Foo:
        """This is a short one line doc string"""
        def __init__(self):

    class Foo:
        """This is a longer doc string that takes a few lines, and is
           only here to demonstrate how you should indent the triple-quotes
           on long doc strings.
           """
        def __init__(self):

  - There are no formal line length limits yet, but try to keep it reasonable.

  - All files must end with "### The End ###". Yes, it's silly.

  - Angles should be measured in degrees

  - Screen coordinates should have the origin at the top-left corner
