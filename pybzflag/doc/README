--- PyBZFlag ---

This is a suite of Python modules that implement the BZFlag network protocol,
and provide the auxiliary logic and interfacing necessary to build clients
and servers that speak the protocol.

Included are a few example programs that make use of the module. Try
them out. Running them with the -h or --help option gives a full list
of command line options supported.

There's no real documentation yet, but there is a good bit of
pseudo-documentation available in the python doc strings. You can extract
this using pydoc.

-- Requirements

Python 2.2 or later is required. There are several recent python features used
by PyBZFlag, but the most notable is that nested scopes are used extensively
in its event handling system and HUD layout.

The core PyBZFlag modules only require the python standard library.
However, most of the graphical code requires pygame (http://pygame.org)
and the Python Imaging Library (http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)
3D views require PyOpenGL (http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/)

The list of available UI modules in --help will reflect the dependencies
currently installed.
