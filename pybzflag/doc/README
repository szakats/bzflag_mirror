--- PyBZFlag ---

This is a suite of Python modules that implement the BZFlag network protocol,
and provide the auxiliary logic and interfacing necessary to build clients
and servers that speak the protocol.

Included are a few example programs that make use of the module. Try
them out. Running them with the -h or --help option gives a full list
of command line options supported.

There's no real documentation yet, but there is a good bit of
pseudo-documentation available in the python doc strings. You can extract
this using pydoc.

-- Requirements

Python 2.2.1 or later is required.
PyBZFlag uses many recent python features, including iterators,
lexical scoping, and the True and False constants.

PyBZFlag uses the Numeric module extensively to perform the fast calculations
necessary for real-time 3D graphics and game state updates, and is required for
nearly all applications of PyBZFlag.

The graphical PyBZFlag modules all require pygame (http://pygame.org) and the
Python Imaging Library (http://pythonware.com/products/pil/)

The 3D modules require PyOpenGL (http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net).

-- Optional Dependencies

The Psyco specializing compiler and the RandomArray companion module to Numeric
are not requried, but both can be utilized to provide decreased load time and
a higher frame rate in some circumstances.

-- Contacts

There is no web site, mailing list, or IRC channel for this project yet.
