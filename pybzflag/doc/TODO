Todo list, in no particular order:

  - Finish the server

  - Bots!

  - Complete the MVC paradigm by implementing controller classes for the player

  - convert panning & rotation in the 3d view to use the logarithmic approacher

  - fix panning in 3d view

  - fix resizing: what might be an SDL bug is causing the window to get stuck
    resizing to its original size when using a WM or equivalent that does
    opaque resizing. Known to break under sawfish, win32, and OS X.

  - The radar is slow. It needs to use display lists. In order to keep the
    'enhanced radar' functionality, the world could be split into a fixed
    number of layers for different heights, then these layers could be stored
    in separate display lists. To render, each layer would be drawn with a
    corresponding calculated alpha value.

  - There is a little HUD code now in GameView. This should be expanded and
    placed in a separate UI.Hud module. It could use some font rendering.
    Looks like it would be relatively easy to write an FTGL-like font
    module for python using pygame's freetype wrapper.

  - Better textures/lighting possibly, maybe multitexturing so long range
    views don't look so boring and the 'grass' isn't so bad. This is supposed
    to be protocol-compatible with BZFlag, but doesn't have to look just like it :)
