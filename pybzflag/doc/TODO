Todo list, in no particular order:

  - Enhance the ThreeDController binding system: move functionality to detect pressed
    buttons and modifiers to separate Criteria classes that can be listed when setting
    a binding. Add a Criteria for the mouse being over a named object. Move binding
    setup to a data/config.py or something similar.

  - Write more documentation :)

  - Complete the Unicode support in GLText. This means deleting rarely used texture pages
    to prevent uncontrolled memory usage, and automatically loading auxiliary fonts
    when a character can't be located.

  - Finish the server

  - Bots!

  - Write a playable client

  - fix resizing: what might be an SDL bug is causing the window to get stuck
    resizing to its original size when using a WM or equivalent that does
    opaque resizing. Known to break under sawfish, win32, and OS X.

  - Better textures/lighting possibly, maybe multitexturing so long range
    views don't look so boring and the 'grass' isn't so bad. This is supposed
    to be protocol-compatible with BZFlag, but doesn't have to look just like it :)
