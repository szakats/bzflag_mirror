Todo list, in no particular order:

  - Add Animated functions for sawtooth, sine, square, and triangle waves. Use
    the sawtooth wave to replace the hardcoded goop in AnimatedTexture.
    Functions should take parameters specifying the range and the period of their output.

  - Complete the Unicode support in GLText. This means deleting rarely used texture pages
    to prevent uncontrolled memory usage, and automatically loading auxiliary fonts
    when a character can't be located.

  - Standardize the viewport coordinates, top-left should be the origin. This will affect
    layout and font rendering.

  - Finish the server

  - Bots!

  - Write a playable client

  - fix resizing: what might be an SDL bug is causing the window to get stuck
    resizing to its original size when using a WM or equivalent that does
    opaque resizing. Known to break under sawfish, win32, and OS X.

  - Better textures/lighting possibly, maybe multitexturing so long range
    views don't look so boring and the 'grass' isn't so bad. This is supposed
    to be protocol-compatible with BZFlag, but doesn't have to look just like it :)
