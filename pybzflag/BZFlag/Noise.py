        # scalar result requires that we 'fold' our sample influences.
        #
        # First we fold across axis 0: This means that all samples with axis
        # zero at 0 will be matched with all samples where axis 0 is 1, and they
        # will be interpolated according to the amount in s. The result will be
        # stored in the influence array, where axis 0 is 0. The locations where
        # axis 0 is 1 will no longer be used.
        #
        # Next it folds across axis 1. Axis 0 is now 'locked', so we only have
        # half as many axes to  match up and interpolate across. The process
        # continues across all axes.
        #
        # The connection with binary digits involves how the axes are mapped
        # to locations in our cube and infl arrays. The least significant bit
        # in the cube index is the last axis, the most significant bit is the
        # first axis. Thus, reading the cube index in binary from left to right,
        # the axes are in increasing order.
        #
        # The first axis we process will then be the high bit. We fold all infl
        # samples by listing all binary numbers with this bit set to 0 and then
        # 1, and interpolate. To 'lock' this bit then is just a matter of decreasing
        # the number of axes we loop over.
        #
        # To keep track of all this bit-banging fun, we have a bit mask indicating
        # the current fold axis. The number of interpolations necessary for that fold
        # will always be equal to this mask. Every time we lock an axis, we just
        # bit-shift this mask right by one. We're done when the mask is zero.

       generator. This is Numeric-friendly, so anywhere you request a value
       for one input coordinate you could also request a value for an
       n-dimensional array of input coordinates.

       Constructor parameters:

          seed          - The seed is combined with the input vector such that the same seed
                          and vector will produce the same output, but for any vector a different
                          seed will produce different output.
                          A seed of zero will use the current time to produce a random seed.

          octaves       - Number of layers (sized at multiples of two) to render noise at. More
                          octaves increase the detail in the noise, but also slow it down.

          persistence   - The amount each successive octave's influence on the final noise is scaled by

          logTableSize  - The base-2 logarithm of the random vector table size. A larger table will
                          produce a noise pattern with more entropy, but will also use more memory.
                          The default should be fine for most purposes.

          dimensions    - Number of dimensions the noise is generated in, and the length of the
                          expected input vectors for get()

          fundamental   - Frequency of the first octave
