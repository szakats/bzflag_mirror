""" BZFlag.UI.GLNoise

Noise rendering algorithms, hardware accelerated by OpenGL.
This module is only for algorithms that require OpenGL. General-purpose
noise algorithms should go in BZFlag.Noise.

The functions here require an ortho mode viewport to be active, and
generally assume they have free reign over the OpenGL backbuffer.
It is assumed that they will be invoked from a dynamic texture class
that creates its own viewport.
