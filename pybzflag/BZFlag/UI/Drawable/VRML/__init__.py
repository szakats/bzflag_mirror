""" BZFlag.UI.Drawable.VRML

A drawable that can load a very small subset of the VRML model format.
This module does not make any attempt to resemble a full VRML browser
implementation. It simply understands small bits of the VRML syntax
and uses this to extract geometry information.

Why VRML?

The other drawables in this directory are here because their geometry
largely depends on per-instance parameters. Objects like player models
and interface widgets, however, need little modification at runtime
and would be much more difficult to construct. Hence, the need for a
model format.

The requirements for this model format didn't leave many options open:

 - Easy to export from Blender
 - Relatively easy to parse
 - Capable of representing multiple named meshes per file, with
   transformation information for each
 - Preferably an open standard

VRML seemed to be the only format meeting all the criteria. There is
already a comprehensive VRML97 browser as part of the OpenGLContext
package, but that would be extreme overkill for our simple needs here.

This has been tested with VRML files from Blender and Milkshape 3D,
as well as a few random VRML files found on the 'net.
