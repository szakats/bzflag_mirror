""" BZFlag.UI.Drawable.GLDrawable

Abstract base class for an object that can be drawn to an OpenGL context.
This is the basic unit used by the ThreeDView to sort objects by texture,
so it is required that the drawable have at most one texture.
The blended flag is used to put objects that need blending into a
second rendering pass.
