""" BZFlag.UI.Viewport

A Viewport in this context is an area that can be drawn to and
provides event handling. The idea is that views associate with
viewports for event handling and some of their context management
rather than directly with the underlying graphics library, so that
it's easy to show multiple views in the same frame.

For every underlying graphics library supported, this module
provides a class that manages event handling for that library.
This includes redraw events, user-supplied events, and connecting
the UI library with the event loop. In turn, the viewport provides
events that views and controllers can hook on to.

The reasoning behind having events multiplex through the view as
well as rendering is so that mouse events can be made relative to
the view, keyboard events can have focus handled, etc. depending
on the needs of a particular view multiplexer class.
