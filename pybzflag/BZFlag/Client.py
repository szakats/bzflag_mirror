       messages related to upkeep on the server-client link, such as
       lag ping, disconnection, and UDP-related messages.

       naming conventions:

         - Low-level socket handlers should be of the form handleFoo()
         - Event handlers for messages should be of the form onMsgFoo()
         - Event handlers for message replies should be of the form onMsgFooReply()
         - Event handlers for other events should be of the form onFoo()

       Members mentioned in the call to initEvents below are observable.
       See the Util.Event class for more information about this feature.
