Todo list, in no particular order:

  - Implement a Server module

  - Move the representation for world objects out of the view code and into the individual world objects
    (Maybe rename the BinaryWorld module, since it wouldn't be limited to binary worlds)

  - Write World methods for loading from text files, and for saving to binary files. This would be
    necessary for a server, and for a map viewer

  - Write a module for generating thumbnails of world files, for sites that index bzflag worlds

  - Complete the MVC paradigm by implementing controller classes for the player

  - Implement proper timer support in the event loop, remove the nasty hack that is used to update views

  - Implement UDP communication
