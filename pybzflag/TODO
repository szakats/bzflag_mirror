Todo list, in no particular order:

  - Implement a Server module

  - Write a module for generating thumbnails of world files, for sites that index bzflag worlds

  - Complete the MVC paradigm by implementing controller classes for the player

  - Implement proper timer support in the event loop, remove the nasty hack that is used to update views

  - Implement UDP communication
