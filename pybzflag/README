--- PyBZFlag ---

This is a suite of Python modules that implement the BZFlag network protocol,
and provide the auxiliary logic and interfacing necessary to build clients
and servers that speak the protocol.

Included are a few example programs that make use of the module.

More should be written here when there's more to say...
For now, read the source to the examples, and read the documentation strings
embedded in the modules' source.
