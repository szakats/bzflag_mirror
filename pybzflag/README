--- PyBZFlag ---

This is a suite of Python modules that implement the BZFlag network protocol,
and provide the auxiliary logic and interfacing necessary to build clients
and servers that speak the protocol.

Included are a few example programs that make use of the module. Try
them out. Note that the examples that connect to a BZFlag server default
to localhost, but you can set this with the -s command line option. Try
the -h or --help option for a full list of command line options supported.

There's no real documentation yet, but there is a good bit of
pseudo-documentation available in the python doc strings. You can extract
this using pydoc. 

-- Requirements

The core PyBZFlag modules only require the python standard library.
However, the graphical UI modules require pygame. (http://pygame.org)
