Basic Installation
==================
There shouldn't be too much involved in installing bzedit.
These three lines should suffice:
	# make
	# make install

If you need custom compiler/linker options, you can
change these by editing the makefile.

bzedit requires OpenGL, GLU, GTK+, GNOME, and gtkglarea
