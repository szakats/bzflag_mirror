<h2>MOTD Version Field Rules</h2>
<br>
<ol>
  <li>Version "0.0" is a special version that applies to ALL BZFlag
versions since MOTD was introduced (1.10).</li>
  <li>Before version 2.0.6, BZFlag used a strict version number match;
that is, 2.0.2 will match on "2", "2.0," and "2.0.2" only.</li>
  <li>Version 2.0.6 and newer in the 2.0 line, and old 2.1s, can use
globbing (via bzglob), against the whole app version string
("2.0.8.20060203-MAINT-W32VC7-SDL", for instance).&nbsp; ? matches any
one character, * matches any string.</li>
  <li>Recent 2.1 releases and all newer use case-insensitive
regexes.&nbsp; They will simulate the older rules where applicable
(except for globbing); any version field that begins with a digit will
be matched according to the old rules, so if you want to use regexes
starting at the beginning of the string, use ^ to do so explicitly.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Convenient Regex Versioning Templates</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Match a single version: ^2\.1\.11\.</li>
  <li>Match a version range: ^2\.1\.[7-15]\.</li>
  <li>Match a particular platform or group of platforms: -W32VC[78]D?-</li>
  <li>Match a particular build: ^2\.1\.11\.20071120-DEVEL-linux-gnu-SDL</li>
</ol>
<h2>Update Notification Triggers</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Set the title field to "UPGRADE: BZFlag &lt;version&gt;" (i.e.
"UPGRADE: BZFlag 2.0.10")</li>
  <li>Set the message field to the URI for the windows installer to
enable automatic upgrades.</li>
  <li>Set the version number to trigger for the minor version it
replaces (i.e. "^2\.1\.[0-9]+" when 2.2.0 is released, "^2\.2\.[0-3]"
when 2.2.4 is released, etc).</li>
  <li>Note that it is not safe to trigger update notification on
non-windows platforms for versions prior to 2.0.11.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
