I want to say thank you for the game... we've been having a blast with it!!!! ... Thanks again for providing us with stress relief at the end of a work day. --V.S.<br><br>

First of all, I`d like to thank you for writing BZFlag. Without a doubt, its the best (and most entertaining!) software we have on these machines. ... Once again, on behalf of all the SGI users here at [company], many many thanks for writing probably the best game we have.... --S.L.<br><br>

Very nice game! Thank you very much! Addictive to the extreme! --E.D.<br><br>

It is an amazing game.... It may ruin my life. Is there a BZFlag anonymous help club? --S.Y.<br><br>

Great game, killer, love it. --B.K.<br><br>

We have been using 1.5 and *LOVE* it! --J.P.A.<br><br>

There's a group of us in [a company's support division] who find this game a great way to relieve the stress built up after a hard day being polite to idiot customers! --D.B.<br><br>

This game is totally awsome!!! I would love to play this at home or over the Net. --J.M.<br><br>

Here, in Hungary BZFlag means many crazy nights sitting in front of an SGI machine. ... I've seen many games before I worked for SGI, but in this game there's something special.... --P.S.<br><br>

I just installed your new BZFlag and I love it. We have been avid players for a year or so. --D.H.<br><br>

Fantastic game. --T.Y.<br><br>

Well, I guess I don't have to tell you that BZFlag a *great* strategy game, because you might already know that.... --W.K.<br><br>

[BZFlag] kicks butt!! Me and my workmate play on a daily basis on our 02's and R5000's. We love it ... give us more!! --T.A.<br><br>

Just wanted to say that this is the best game ever! I love this game.<br>
... The cleanest kills, the most excitement, the best stratagies, [BZFlag] is the best. ... I thank you for this wonderfull gift; the best software on any system. --R.D.W.<br><br>

The PC guys at work here are really quite envious of BZFlag and would probably kill me to get their hands on it. --S.L.<br><br>

BZFlag is GREAT! Two friends and I have a small network of Indigo2's and love going after each other on the battlefield. --R.H.<br><br>

Thanks for a smashing game. --J.D.<br><br>
