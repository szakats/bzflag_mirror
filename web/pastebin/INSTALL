Requirements:
=============
- PHP 4.1 or higher (works with register-globals off)
- MySQL database server (now optional)

- For short url generation, Apache with mod_rewrite available. Something
  like the following configuration options should be used

    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteRule /([a-z0-9]+) /pastebin.php?show=$1

  If mod_rewrite is not available, modify the shorturl() function to 
  generate 'normal' urls.

- For instant "private" pastebins on subdomains, you'll need a wildcard
  DNS entry pointing at your server and ensure that pastebin virtual host
  is the first virtual host on your server. There may be other ways to 
  accomplish this, this was just the easiest for me.
  
  
Installation
============

The tarball contains two main directories. You'll need a virtual host
set up something like this

<VirtualHost *>
    DocumentRoot /path/to/pastebin/public_html
    ServerName your.domain.name.com

    php_value include_path .:/path/to/pastebin/lib
    php_value register_globals off
    DirectoryIndex pastebin.php
    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteRule /([a-z0-9]+) /pastebin.php?show=$1

</VirtualHost>  

The main element here is to ensure that the lib directory is on the search
path. You could alternatively place your settings in an .htaccess file if 
you wish

You can, if you wish, simply copy the contents of the lib directory into
the same directory as pastebin.php, but it's better practice to prevent it
being accessible via HTTP.


If using the "mysql" storage engine, setup a new database with the following 
table

CREATE TABLE `pastebin` (
	  `pid` int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
	  `poster` varchar(16) default NULL,
	  `posted` datetime default NULL,
	  `code` text,
	  `parent_pid` int(11) default '0',
	  `format` varchar(16) default NULL,
	  `codefmt` mediumtext,
	  `codecss` text,
	  `domain` varchar(255) default '',
	  `expires` DATETIME,
	  `expiry_flag` ENUM('d','m', 'f') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'm',
	  
	  PRIMARY KEY  (`pid`),
	  KEY `domain` (`domain`),
	  KEY `parent_pid`,
	  KEY `expires`
	);

create table recent
(
	domain varchar(255),
	pid int not null,
	seq_no int not null,
	
	primary key(domain,seq_no)
);


If using the "file" storage engine, make sure the public_html/../posts 
directory is writable by the webserver.

Now you need to edit you base configuration file. Make a copy of 
lib/config/default.conf.php	and call the file my.domain.conf.php

For example, if your domain is superpaste.com, you'd call the file
superpaste.com.conf.php

Edit the file to configure the software to your requirements. You
can create alternative configurations for other host names simply
by creating a new configuration file.

That's it, you're good to go. Good luck!
