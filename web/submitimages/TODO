TODO List
-------------------------------------------------
- The file MD5 was just added to the database. Next thing to do with this is
  to run a check in the moderation queue to identify previously rejected images

- Make the moderation queue and the upload form submission pages have a proper
  HTML feedback page instead of the debug text.

- Copy in author details for the images, and display the data when browsing the
  image directories.  Make a nice display system as well, possibly with
  thumbnail previews.
