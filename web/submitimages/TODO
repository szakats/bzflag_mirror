TODO List
-------------------------------------------------
- The file MD5 was just added to the database. Next thing to do with this is
  to run a check in the moderation queue to identify previously rejected images

- Make the moderation queue page have a proper HTML feedback page instead of the
  debug text.

- Copy in author details for the images, and display the data when browsing the
  image directories.  Make a nice display system as well, possibly with
  thumbnail previews.

- Actually send out email...

- Allow users to view their own pending images.

- Move the rest of the website's text into the language file.

- Add a warning to the user if they don't re-enter the file to upload after a
  server-side error is detected.

- Clear the TOS and accuracy checkboxes under Uploader Information if all files
  were uploaded sucessfully.

- Verify that the JavaScript input validation matches the PHP input validation.
