TODO List
-------------------------------------------------

- Make the moderation queue page have a proper HTML feedback page instead of
  the debug text.

- Move the rest of the website's text into the language file.

- Add a warning to the user if they don't re-enter the file to upload after a
  server-side error is detected.

- Clear the TOS and accuracy checkboxes under Uploader Information if all
  files were uploaded sucessfully.

- Filter out odd characters

- Allow commenting on images so that we don't always have to reject

- Allow editing the details of an uploaded image so that a user wouldn't have
  to resubmit (goes along with the previous item)

- Allow accepting/rejecting multiple images at once

- Throw together some batch import script that can read a zip file full of
  images
