 Building on Windows with the language files
---------------------------------------------

Although parser.cxx, parser.hxx and lexer.cxx are included in the
source tree, one should *NOT* modify them, for they are 
autogenerated by the flex and bison tools, from the lexer.l and
parser.y files.

You'll need flex and bison versions for windows to do that. You
can either use the ones shipped with Cygwin (if you install it) or
download a port of them to the windows platform for example from 
then GnuWin32 project ( http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/ ) :

Flex  : http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/flex.htm
Bison : http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/bison.htm

If you use bison or flex from other sources, be sure that flex is
at least version 2.5.4 and bison at least 1.875.

You'll need to have them in your PATH for the automated build of
MSVC to work.
