BZWorkbench Installation Notes
------------------------------

To compile BZWorkbench, just cd into Debug and run "make all".
Aside from usual dependency on a GNU build environment, BZWorkbench has 
the following library and source dependencies:

	(*)	FLTK 1.1.7
	(*)	OpenSceneGraph 2.0
	(*)	OpenGL 1.4


To run BZWorkbench, you should either copy, move, or symlink the 
bzworkbench binary to the root of the source tree.  Otherwise, it will 
crash (i.e. it expects to find certain files relative to the root of the 
source tree, rather than relative to the Debug directory).  Given that 
this project is still in its infancy, there is no "make install" command.
