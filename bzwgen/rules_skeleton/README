Guidelines for rules creation/edition
======================================

Namespaces
-----------
BZWGen does not have namespaces (yet), rules from every file sit in
one global namespace. Hence it is encouraged to create your own 
namespaces using the underline character. The namespaces should match
in a way the file they are introduced in. 

Files
------
There's an encouragement to keep every building "style" in a single file,
with it's own namespace. If a rule is used in more than one building 
style, think about moving it into "common.set".

Special files
--------------

init.set -- holding just one special rule "initialize" that is called
right after the parser reads all rules.

common.set -- holding rules used by all of the sets.

start.set -- holding the special "start" rule, that is executed fith
the face of a single building lot.
