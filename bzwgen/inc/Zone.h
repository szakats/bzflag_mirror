 * @brief Defines a map zone
 *
 * A map zone is a part of a planar division. Zones have their own generation
 * algorithm (be it scatter, L-Systems, or static mesh). Probably in the future,
 * there will be a way to define a ComplexZone that has it's own Zone division.
 * Currently however it's both the most discreet as well as the most global
 * division of the map.
