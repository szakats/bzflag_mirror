 TODO file for bzwgen
======================

* Roof types - for non-skyscraper buildings, this might need some few grammar operations implemented

* .bzw object placement - for allowing the placement of arbitrary .bzw objects, will need a place object rule

* Separate floor levels for buildings - so they look more real, with doors too

* Non-quad shapes - badly needed

* Multishapes - will need a serious rehaul of the grammar to implement 

* Scatter maps - like the default random bzfs map but better

* Definition files - for generator flavours

* Documentation of the source code - it's getting less and less self-explanatory
