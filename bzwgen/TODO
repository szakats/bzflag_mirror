 TODO file for bzwgen
======================

* Texture coords - currently I just assume that the texturing is done autmatically

* Attributes in the grammar - basically C-like defines that are allowed to be set and retrieved instead of numbers

* Roof types - for non-skyscraper buildings, this might need some few grammar operations implemented

* Triangulation/Convexation algorithm - to handle non-convex shapes

* Fixing expand to handle non-convex shapes properly

* Snapgrids - to make buildings follow set snap lines, needs Attributes to be implemented

* .bzw object placement - for allowing the placement of arbitrary .bzw objects, will need a place object rule

* Multi-mesh zones - zones should have the ability to hold multiple meshes, not just one, the sidewalk should be a separate mesh

* Separate floor levels for buildings - so they look more real, with doors too

* Non-quad shapes - badly needed

* Tesselate algorithm - quad to oct for example

* Multishapes - will need a serious rehaul of the grammar though :/

* Bases support - needed to make the thing useful xP

* Scatter maps - like the default random bzfs map but better

* Definition files - for generator flavours

* Command line arguments - at least to change output name :P

* N-gon generation - for non quad buildings

* Better zone split algorithm - the current one sucks badly

* Documentation of the source code - it's getting less and less self-explanatory

* Documentation of the grammar files - badly needed
