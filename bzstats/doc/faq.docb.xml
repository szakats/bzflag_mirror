			<question>
				<para>I think the player scores are wrong.</para>
			</question>
			<answer>
				<para>The scores that you see during the game are not logged to the logfile.
				The score that &bzstats; reports are based on the kills, deaths and suicides
				it sees in the logfile. This accounts for the score over the period that is logged
				in the logfile.</para>

				<para>I think the team statistics are wrong.</para>
			</question>
			<answer>
				<para>A player's team is only logged when joining the game.
