bzupdate.pl is the script used to populate the stats tables.  ths
script should be added to cron to run every 5 or so minutes.

It needs to die.

bzfls.php should gather the stats when it connects back
instead of just connecting and closing the connection.

mysqldump -d -h localhost -u{user} -p{password} bzflag > database_structure.sql

generates the dump
