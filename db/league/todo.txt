TODO:

always:
	- better security (eg. .. )

misc:
	+ fix the design (or use the old one)
	- a generic makeLink function()
	- use templates 
	+ fix entermatch (displayes SID)
	+ highligt new matches, since last login.
	+ fix authentication. You need to reload to get the correct menu,
	  just after authentication.
	- restructure every file, one by one.
	+ chestal: one more suggestion for the league code: When replying, the code adds Re:. When replying to a reply, it does so again, I think it should stick with just one Re:, not Re: re: Re: etc.
	+ add flag to forums, to disable team. (done directly in database)

	- remember: check todo list after migration.

teams:
	+ add state active.
	+ dont show deleted teams.
	+ teampage: display fights
	+ teamadmin: teamleader/admin can change leadership

cron:
	+ delete a team when none of its memebrs has been logged on for 3 months
	+ delete team, when its flagged deleted (dissmissed)
	+ after the team removal, remove all teamless players that haven't been logged in for 3 months, too
	+ check if teams have played a match during the last 3 months, mark these as active, others are inactive
	+ assign playerposts to a "deleted player"
	+ assign teamsfights to a "deleted team"
	- change deleted player/team to a special player (dosnt make sense to send mail to deleted player)

look at todo on site.
