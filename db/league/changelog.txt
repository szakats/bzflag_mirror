*	12-05-2003:
		- Changed sendmessage. Now only one "Re:" should appear even if replying to a message prefixed with "Re:"
		- recreated the following teams (with matches): penguins, BZ:Evolved, The Untouchables. The are already 
		  flagged for deletion. :) Recreating these teams is done by migration.php
*	11-05-2003:
		- changed teams listing. Now the list is divided into "active", "inactive", and "havnt played matches" (as the current production site)
		- improved session handling. Not possible to steal session unless you share the ip of the target.
		- added last 10 matches on teampage.
		- added the possibility to change leader (by either leader or admin)
		- created cron.php. it cleans up playerlist, teamlist and marks active teams.
		- changed displayRating() to reflect changes made by chestal on production site.
		- changed "entermatch". now displays active teams at top.
		- update migration.php: now drops unused tables.
		- changed "entermatch". Now marks both teams as active when a result is entered. 
		- bzforum: new topics since last login is displayed with red in the overview.
		- posts with no subject, is no renamed to "(no subject)" - and is therefor clickable.

*	10-05-2003: migration.php
		Migration script created. Takes care of all database changes.

*	13-04-2003: New structure. 
		Done restructuring. The code itself wasnt changed much (except for get/post/session handling/vars). To enabled the new SESSION handling, the table l_session now allows empty callsigns. SQL: ALTER TABLE `l_session` CHANGE `callsign` `callsign` VARCHAR( 40 )

*	13-04-2003: Changed l_player. added "created" and last_login. Both datetime. 
		SQL: ALTER TABLE `l_player` ADD `created` DATETIME NOT NULL AFTER `level` , ADD `last_login` DATETIME NOT NULL AFTER `created` ; 
		To update these fields, you need to run migration.php

*	13-04-2003: Changed l_team.status from SET to ENUM. Added 'deleted' as possible value from status.
		SQL: ALTER TABLE `l_team` CHANGE `status` `status` ENUM( 'opened', 'closed', 'deleted' ) DEFAULT 'opened' NOT NULL
		SQL: ALTER TABLE `l_team` ADD `status_changed` DATETIME NOT NULL AFTER `status` 
		* should "teams" (the page) contain deleted teams as well?
		* some cronjob should check the database from deleted teams, with no matches. And remove them with DELETE from DB. Perhaps
		* having a week or two before it will be removed.
